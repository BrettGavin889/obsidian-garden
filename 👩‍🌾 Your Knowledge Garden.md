# 👋 Welcome to your Knowledge Garden

[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨🌱 Obsidian Garden|🪨🌱 The Obsidian Garden]] is a open-source guide to creating your own [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management System]] with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).

The garden is a system in itself - designed as a template for you to learn the basics of working with [[📇 Terms/Obsidian|Obsidian]]

## 🔗 Creating Connections
💡 Great ideas happen when there is an [[📇 Terms/Connection|connection]] between knowledge and inspiration.

For thousands of years humans have tried to make sense of the world around them. Scientists, philosophers, writers, and even you and [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/🧑🏻‍💻 Tane Piper|I]] try to categorise it, understand how it works and create [[📇 Terms/System|systems]] that allow us to store and process this knowledge.

Each time this has allowed new ideas to form, adding to the collective [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]] from which more build on - but in our modern world there are so many distractions and so much new information to process that it can be really hard to see the [[📇 Terms/Link|links]] between things.

From our own minds, to a collection of half-filled notebooks in a drawer and from a bookshelf of unread books to your nearest library - all contain the inspiration we need to think of our next great idea.

## 💩 Avoiding Information Rot
⛔️ When it come to storing our ideas - in the worst-case we use only our brain. 

When we do this, an idea can only exist within the boundaries of our own imagination. No one else yet knows about your idea (unless there is a [Multiple Discovery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_discovery) - but this also means you're losing out). 

Without communicating this idea the first real risk in [[🌱 Seed Box/Information Rot|Information Rot]] is you! 

In the west, oral tradition is unreliable - telling people about your idea is great, but passed on information tends to be unreliable and incomplete. Only the source is truly reliable, and even then at risk of forgetting details.

The only way to truly capture an idea is to write it down, draw it, or record it. Even here there's a risk that without one single place to put it all - you will miss out on [[📇 Terms/Connection|connecting]] it all together. 

In [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]] systems there is concept of the *"second brain"* - a dynamic and visual hard drive that we can consciously put our stream of thoughts and ideas in to. 

On top of this we build the [[🏞 Digital Garden]] idea - in this guide known as the **Knowledge Garden** - this is not a new idea, instead we build on this concept and use it as a base template to show a working system.

## 🧠 Creating a second brain
Using [[📇 Terms/Obsidian|Obsidian]] and this guide you can use it to create your own system - either by extending, or creating your own from scratch.

By extending Obsidian with [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨 Obsidian/🔌 Plugins & 🌈 Theme|🔌 Plugins and a 🌈 Theme]] we can start to build with more functionality for creating and querying the underlying data.

This guide is designed to get you starting in understanding why a [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Garden]] is useful and to help reduce the learning curve.

## 🌺 Letting Ideas Flourish
⏳ Like a real garden, good ideas need nurtured and take time to grow - but can reap rewards when cared for correctly.

To escape the distractions of life we can visit our [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🪨🌱 Obsidian Garden|Obsidian Garden|Knowledge Garden]] to reconnect with [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds|🌱 new]] and [[🪴 Grow Room|🪴 old]] knowledge and create [[📇 Terms/Link|links]] between them so we can see the [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Graph|Knowledge Graph]] that connects them.

Adding enhanced richness with `#tags` and `Variables::` allows us to perform [[searches]] and [[build queries]] that allow us to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🎯 Create Custom Dashboards|🎯 Create Custom Dashboards]] and code blocks that let us see through the overgrowth of all the data - display tables, and lists - both basic to do items.

### Suggested flow
The suggested flow shows one way of thinking how items are handled - when you have an idea (or want to collect a link, a picture of a doodle, create a contact) you can start with a [[⏣ Templates/🗒 Basic Note]] - or select a more detailed ⏣ Template. 

All items start in the 🌱 Seed Box - an inbox for all items that need [[triage]].  Items can then go into the immediate 🪵 Backlog, or be categorised and filed - once items have been created they create new opportunities for new ideas to be created.

## 🌱 Start By Planting

The garden is somewhere to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds|plant seeds]] (your ideas) and let them grow. You don't need to be there all there time to tend to it, but when you do - you see new insights and information that wasn't visible before.

When you're ready to get started on your next great idea - a new book, the next billion dollar web app, or just de-weeding and tending to your current challenges -  having a knowledge garden allows you to start querying and questioning the data, building up outcomes from research topics and reference content and using it to discover more new great ideas.

Each [[👨‍👧‍👦 People|person]]'s garden is different - some like order, everything in rows and well manicured, some prefer it to be more organic and messy with the occasional tidy-up. All of them require regular tending and curating to make sure you can harvest information .

## 🧑‍🌾 Curating Your Garden

The garden is designed for anyone who wants to create their own [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Management|Knowledge Management]] system to currate content and ideas. The [[📇 Terms/Obsidian|Obsidian]] way is to use a lot of [[📇 Terms/Link|links]], `#tags` and [[📇 Terms/Connection|connections]] (and I mean A LOT!).

Starting by [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds|Creating Seeds]] - these will appear in your [[🪴 Grow Room]] - a dashboard that shows both the 🌱 Seed Box and your 🪵 Backlog.

From there you can prune or currate your content - I've tried to provide a simple model of how you can generate ideas.



## 💾 Installing The Guide

The easiest way to start is clone [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/tanepiper/obsidian-garden) containing the most up to date version, or download it as a zip file.

> `git clone https://github.com/tanepiper/obsidian-garden.git`

First [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds|create seeds]] with one of the templates (like [[⏣ Templates/🗒 Basic Note]]). and start writing down ideas, book you want to read, projects you want to research. As you type, you'll begin to notice words, people, places, and concepts that you want to start looking in to - creating [[📇 Terms/Link|links]] and clicking on them will create more seeds that you can collect more knowledge in.

### 💊 Triage the 🌱 Seed Box and the 

[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds|Seeds]] start off needing triaged - while a seed lives in the 🌱 Seed Box it's still needs nurtured so it can be ready to be planted in the correct location.

The box is where all new ideas go - random thoughts, long ideas, screenshots and pictures and audio notes. Work on files in the 🌱 Seed Box and only move them when ready.

Once a seed has been moved to the correct location you can update the [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/⚠️ Statuses|status]] - these drive the dashboards like [[📚 Reading]] or [[👨‍👧‍👦 People]] - you can also learn to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🎯 Create Custom Dashboards|Create Custom Dashboards]] allowing a more fine-grained view of what the garden contains.

Once you're ready, feel free to change this readme and turn it into your home dashboard.
