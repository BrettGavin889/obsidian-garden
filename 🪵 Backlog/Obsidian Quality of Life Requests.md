## File Enhancements

- [ ] Add support for an ignore file (`.obsidianignore`) that allows files and folders to be added that [[ðŸ“‡ Terms/Obsidian|Obsidian]] will ignore and not load into the UI or consider in the database
- [ ] Add a [[ðŸ“‡ Terms/Front Matter|Front Matter]] property `noGraph: true` that when added removes the file from the graph
