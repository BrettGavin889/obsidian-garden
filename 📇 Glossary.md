## ðŸ“‡ Glossary of Terms
This is a collected glossary of items with the `#term` tag

The page will automatically build a list of alphabetically-sorted terms - you can also [[ðŸ“‡ Terms/Link|link]] to this page to create a graph connection.

```dataview
table category as "Category"
from #term 
where file.name != "ðŸ”– New Term"
sort file.name ASC
```
