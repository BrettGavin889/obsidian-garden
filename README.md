## Welcome to your Knowledge Garden

![The Knowledge Garden](.github/the-knowledge-garden.png)

The [Obsidian Garden](https://obsidian.garden) is a knowledge system and guide in helping you create your own knowledge system.

Using [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - a tool for creating your knowledge base and *"second brain"*.

> At this time the project is in active development and subject to changes, it also contains spelling and grammar mistakes that will be reviewed later.

While this project uses Markdown, GitHub cannot render them.  You can view it on the Obsidian publishing platform at  [https://obsidian.garden](https://obsidian.garden) - however it does not yet support all plugins, but can still be a useful guide.

To get the full experience, clone this repository and use [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) to view.
