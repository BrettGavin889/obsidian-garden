> Plant a new 🌱 seed to grow into an 🌺 idea.

## What is the 🪨🌱 Obsidian Garden?
Like any person with ADHD, I've tried several systems and invented a few myself - for me nothing has ever stuck - I even tried [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) before - but found it's UI difficult and not much help.

Things change, and ideas grow - after discussing note taking apps I decided to give Obsidian a try again - I watched [[👨‍👧‍👦 People/👤 Alexis Rondeau]]'s video [How to use Obsidian to write a book](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pP4AeGY2mz4) - after this something just clicked.  

Within hours I already had things close to how I liked it. This document I'm writing now is about 24 hours later - I didn't waste any time getting started on making a great template for myself to use, but also to share.

Based on what I've learned in that short time, I've tried to come up with a simple idea that is reusable - a structure that contains a way to create connections, to set up goals and to capture knowledge.  The garden and seed idea are not new, but I've tried to crystalise it into a set of principles for [[📇 Terms/Knowledge Management]].

## The Garden Analogy
I myself enjoy gardening - both in my own back yard, and an allotment with greenhouse, raised beds and berry bushes.  As you learn the ways of gardening it helps see how nurturing and growing plants leads to a rewarding harvest.

First you need to sow your crops - either from seeds or cutting  ([[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds]]).  This stage is slow, you are planting in the hope that some will come up.  The one's that do, you transport to your growing area - carefully planting the, providing them nourishment and water and keeping beasts at bay from destroying them - this stage is also slow, and takes effort - but within a few weeks or months you are rewarded with a rich harvest of fruits and vegetables

This is the same with ideas - I'm constantly coming up with lots - but have them across lots of different paper and app locations and it's difficult to see the connections - by having this garden

## Principles

### Consistant Frontmatter
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/⚠️ Statuses]]

Each template file contains a set of frontmatter properties, the most important being `status`.  The defaults for the field are sensible: `triage`, `ready`, `in progress` and `done`.  Using these allows queries to be generated that show a particular status.  The field is customisable, and there are more properties available in each template - so feel free to use your own to build more complex query sets.

### Sensible Templates
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🌱 Creating Seeds]]

Each template also has a sensible set of default layouts and purpose - for example the [[⏣ Templates/📙 New Reading Item]] template has sections for quotes, questions and reviews.

### Query-driven pages
[[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🎯 Create Custom Dashboards]]

Query-driven pages live at the top level of the garden, for example [[📚 Reading]] and [[👨‍👧‍👦 People]], as well as the [[README]] file. These allow quick access to pages that let you see the underlying data in your files.
