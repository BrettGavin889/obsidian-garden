## How to use statuses
A `status` is a frontmatter property contained in all the ⏣ Template files.  This status is designed to help understand where a file's current progress is in being usable as data - rather than the file being finished - and use this to [[👩‍🌾 Gardening Tips/🎯 Create Custom Dashboards]]  

Not all files need a status type (such as these tutorial files) - and it's mostly used to indicate that a file or idea has been dealt with - even when set to `done` this does not mean the file will never change again!

For myself these statues are more to make sure I'm aware of active progress in the system - from brain dump, through to reordering and refactoring, to having the information and connections be clear.

To keep the system simple, there are currently 4 default statuses that can be used.

- `triage` - Set when a file has been created, used to indicate it has not yet been sorted and categorised
- `ready` - Set after triage is done, but you are not yet ready to process the file
- `in progress` - Set when you are editing and adding to the file and making active changes to it
- `done` - Set when you are satisfied the file has enough information in it's current state
